# Overview

"three.cpp" and "three.hpp" are two files defining the different objects required for the program. It is possible to create images or videos, save them in text files, and replay them from the same file.

"main.cpp" is an example of creating a 3D scene and producing a video. "video.txt" and "large-video.txt" are two examples of videos created by me using the program.

Overall, the program is relatively simple to understand. If you want to explore all the objects and their member functions, read the comments in "three.hpp", which serves as a mini-documentation.

If any errors arise, let me know and/or fix them. There might be a few bugs :)

If you want to run the program on your own:
```bash
g++ -std=c++14 main.cpp three.cpp -o main && ./main
```
